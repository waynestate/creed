# Deploy gate

The deploy gate runs PROCTOR against the commit being released, before it is
released, and refuses EOL PHP (ADR-0006).

- The deploy-time rule set is small, offline and fast: the target image's
  status and its PHP version against `policy.json`, the framework and stack
  package versions in `composer.lock`, and known advisories from a cached
  database (ADR-0006).
- EOL fails: a deploy that regresses a rule, a new app that fails any rule, or
  an expired override is blocked (ADR-0006).
- It ratchets: a deploy that doesn't make things worse always passes
  (ADR-0006).
- Each rule moves through stages, `report`, `warn`, `block`, with dates in
  `policy.json` (ADR-0006).

## On Citadel

- Citadel runs the gate in its release hook: `proctor gate` in `runGitPull()`,
  against the fetched commit, before it is checked out (ADR-0006).
- The gate is pending the Citadel team (D-005). Until it is adopted,
  enforcement is CI on GitLab (ADR-0006).

## Elsewhere

- The same gate runs as a CI job through PREFLIGHT's `proctor` component,
  wherever the pipeline runs (first-repos).
- SQUIRE's `docker` target will run the gate before it ships an image, and so
  will its later `openshift` and `coolify` targets (ADR-0010).
