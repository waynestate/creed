## What the stack supports

The policy lists the MySQL versions in `policy/policy.json`, under `mysql`:
5.6, 5.7, 8.0, 8.4 and 9.7, each with its `active_until` and `security_until`
dates. The shared server runs 5.6, which is past security support; its
`security_until` is 2021-02-28. Laravel 13 documents MySQL 5.7 or later. The
conventions below are how apps live with the shared server until it is
upgraded. The stack accepts the server as it is, With Arms Wide Open.

## Conventions that keep 5.6 working

- Set `Schema::defaultStringLength(191)` in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`,
  before any migration runs. 5.6 caps an indexed `utf8mb4` column at 767
  bytes, which is 191 characters.
- Keep `utf8mb4` and `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, the defaults. Never use an
  8.0-only collation such as `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (not yet confirmed on a
  5.6 server).
- Store JSON as `text` or `longText`, with Eloquent `array` or `json` casts,
  and filter in PHP. 5.6 has no JSON column type.
- Leave `use_upsert_alias` unset. The upsert alias is not available on 5.6.
- Rename a column with raw `DB::statement('ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE ...')`.
  Avoid `renameColumn` and `renameIndex`, which emit 5.7 syntax.
- Use `Schema::hasTable` only. Column introspection is not reliable on 5.6.
- Skip `db:show` and `db:monitor`, and run one database-queue worker (or
  another driver if the platform offers one). 5.6 has no `SKIP LOCKED`, so a
  single worker avoids double-processing.
- Use `timestamp`, not `date`, for `useCurrent()`. A `date` column cannot
  take a current-timestamp default on 5.6.
- Run migrations in CI against a real 5.6 container. SQLite-only tests pass
  code that 5.6 rejects.

## Avoid until the server is upgraded

### Schema

- JSON and jsonb columns
- Generated columns
- `renameIndex` and `renameColumn`
- Column introspection
- `invisible`, `instant` and `vector` columns
- InnoDB `spatialIndex` (needs 5.7.5, not yet confirmed on a 5.6 server)
- DESC indexes and CHECK constraints

### Queries

- `whereJson*` and JSON-path updates
- Window functions and CTEs
- `SKIP LOCKED` and `NOWAIT` in raw SQL
- `joinLateral`
- Joined deletes with an order or a limit

### Commands

- `db:show`
- `db:monitor`

## Moving to 8.4

Code that follows the conventions and avoids the patterns above runs unchanged
on 8.4. The server-side large-prefix settings (`innodb_large_prefix=ON`,
`innodb_file_format=Barracuda`, DYNAMIC rows) are a question for the database
owners, not something an app sets (not yet confirmed on a 5.6 server). Passing
`ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` through the `engine` config is likewise not yet confirmed
on a 5.6 server.

## How the stack checks it

PROCTOR will flag the patterns in the avoid list above. Not yet.
