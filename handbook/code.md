# Code

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY in this chapter are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## PHP style

- Laravel apps MUST use Pint's `laravel` preset (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- Raw PHP apps and the stack's own packages MUST use the `per` preset, PER
  Coding Style 3.1 (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- A repo MUST use one formatter, never two (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- An app gets the preset through Pint's config: a root `pint.json` with a
  `preset` key (what Sourdough bakes ship), or `--config
  vendor/waynestate/pinstripe/pint/<preset>.json` (what Pinstripe's docs show)
  (the stack's coding standard).
- Files MUST be UTF-8 without a BOM, with LF line endings (the stack's
  every-OS design). PROCTOR check: `gitattributes-eol` (the LF pins; nothing checks for a BOM yet).

## Reading the code

- Comment where it helps: complex logic, areas that could improve, business rules that would otherwise be a mystery (SHOULD). Version history MUST NOT live in comments; git is the change log (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- Code that no longer runs MUST be removed, not commented out; git keeps it (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- Variable, class and database names SHOULD be complete and descriptive; avoid ambiguous abbreviations (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.

## Source control and documentation

- All source MUST be kept in git. Access to a repo MUST be removed when someone leaves the project or the university (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- The stack's code has its primary home on git.wayne.edu; the standards name git.wayne.edu as the preferred home.
- A project SHOULD register in the catalog Enterprise Apps names, and keep its environments current. Stack apps also register with Rollcall, the stack's census (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- Every repo's README MUST say how to install, configure and deploy the code for local development, on every OS (see `every-os.md`), and how to update an existing deployment (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- If the Help Desk might be contacted about the project, the repo SHOULD keep an overview: what it does, who uses it, known common issues and who to call for an incident, and changes SHOULD be delivered to the Help Desk when it changes (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.

## Static analysis

- New code MUST run PHPStan at level 8: the stack's own packages and every
  app Sourdough generates (the stack's coding standard). Held by: Preflight's
  `phpstan` component, running Pinstripe's level 8 preset.
- Larastan loads only where Laravel is present (the stack's coding standard).
- Every inline ignore MUST carry an identifier and a reason, and configs MUST
  set `reportIgnoresWithoutComments` (the stack's coding standard). Held by:
  PHPStan itself, which reports an ignore without a comment when the setting
  is on.
- The PHPStan preset leaves `phpVersion` unset, so PHPStan infers it from the
  app's `composer.json` (`config.platform.php`, else `require.php`), and
  PROCTOR's `php-floor` keeps `require.php` off EOL versions (the stack's coding
  standard).
- Existing apps start at the highest level they pass, with a committed
  baseline that MUST NOT grow, then raise the level one step at a time
  (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet. Like the band says,
  the only way is Higher.
- New packages MUST have no baseline (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- Two reasons for level 8:
  - The starters begin clean, so new apps pass from day one (the stack's coding standard).
  - Null handling is the class of bug level 8 adds; in the stack's auth and
    header code, a null bug is a security bug (the stack's coding standard).

## Input and files

- All input (forms, API calls, headers, cookies, and data read from a database you do not control) MUST be validated on the server; SQL uses bound parameters, and output is escaped for where it lands. That guards against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.
- Files from untrusted sources MUST be checked against the expected type, MUST NOT be passed to include, class-loading or reflection calls, MUST be stored outside the served folder with limited permissions, and MUST NOT be executable (WSU developer standards, 2024). No check exists yet.

## Banned patterns

Each ban becomes a PHPStan rule: Larastan's where it has one, `phpstan-disallowed-calls`
for plain bans, and a custom rule only when neither fits.

- Code MUST call `env()` only in `config/` files, from Larastan's
  `NoEnvCallsOutsideOfConfig` rule. PROCTOR check: `env-outside-config`
  (a warning per call); Pinstripe's Laravel cut turns Larastan's rule on
  (`noEnvCallsOutsideOfConfig`, Pinstripe 0.1.4).
- TLS verification MUST NOT be disabled, such as `withoutVerifying()` or
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` set to false (OWASP ASVS). Held by: Pinstripe's
  banned-call rules: `withoutVerifying()` is banned by
  `pinstripe.banned.withoutVerifying` (Pinstripe 0.2.0), and since Pinstripe
  0.3.0 the rest are banned too: `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` set to false or
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` set to 0 (`pinstripe.banned.curlVerifyOff`), a
  stream context that skips the peer check
  (`pinstripe.banned.streamVerifyOff`) and Guzzle's `verify` set to false
  (`pinstripe.banned.verifyFalse`).
- SQL MUST NOT be built by joining strings; use bindings (OWASP SQL Injection
  Prevention Cheat Sheet). Held by: Pinstripe's banned-call rule
  `pinstripe.banned.joinedSql` (since Pinstripe 0.3.0): a variable joined
  into the SQL given to PDO, mysqli, `oci_parse()` (and the old `ociparse()`)
  or Laravel's `DB::` calls fails; literal SQL with bindings passes.
- Debug leftovers and dynamic code MUST NOT appear: `eval()`, `extract()`,
  `var_dump()`, `dd()` and `dump()`. Held by: `phpstan-disallowed-calls`,
  which bans them as `pinstripe.banned.eval`, `pinstripe.banned.extract`,
  `pinstripe.banned.varDump`, `pinstripe.banned.dd` and
  `pinstripe.banned.dump` (Pinstripe 0.2.0,
  https://pinstripe.apps.wayne.edu/docs/reference/banned-calls.html).

## Vue and JavaScript

- JavaScript MUST use ESLint's flat config (the stack's coding standard).
  Held by: Pinstripe's flat configs, run in CI by Preflight's `eslint` component.
- Vue apps MUST use `eslint-plugin-vue`'s `flat/recommended-error`: the
  recommended rules with every warning raised to an error, so the editor, a
  local run and CI agree on what fails; the `-warn` presets keep warnings
  while an app adopts gradually (the stack's coding standard). Held by:
  Pinstripe's flat configs, run in CI by Preflight's `eslint` component.
- Formatting MUST use Prettier (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- Vue apps MUST use `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility` (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- Both JavaScript and TypeScript MUST be linted (the stack's coding standard).
  Held by: Pinstripe's flat configs, run in CI by Preflight's `eslint` component.
- The stack's Inertia starter uses TypeScript; the raw Vue and Blade island
  starters use plain JavaScript, which stays fully supported (the stack's
  coding standard).
- The lint tools MUST run on Node 22.13 or newer (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.

## Security analysis

- An app MUST NOT rely on GitLab SAST: the stack's GitLab instances run the
  Free tier (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- The open tools instead: Larastan's env rule, `phpstan-disallowed-calls`,
  and a Psalm taint-analysis pilot on one app (the stack's coding standard).

## How it is enforced

- Pint, PHPStan, Rector dry-runs and ESLint run in CI through Preflight
  components, not in the deploy gate (the stack's coding standard). Preflight 0.8.0
  ships the `pint`, `phpstan` and `eslint` components; a Rector dry-run component
  is Planned.
- New rules arrive as warnings and become errors on a stated date, the same
  staging as PHP versions (the stack's enforcement design).
- PROCTOR reports whether an app uses the presets (the stack's coding standard). The PROCTOR
  report is Planned.

## Which preset enforces each rule

| Rule | Preset file | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PHP style, Laravel apps | `pint/laravel.json` | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| PHP style, raw PHP apps and stack packages | `pint/per.json` | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| Static analysis, level 8 | `phpstan/base.neon` | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| Static analysis, raw apps | `phpstan/raw.neon` | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| Static analysis, Laravel apps | `phpstan/laravel.neon` | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| Banned patterns | `phpstan/disallowed.neon` | Built (Pinstripe 0.2.0; the joined SQL and TLS-off bans in 0.3.0) |
| Vue and JavaScript | `eslint/javascript.js` and `eslint/typescript.js` (npm `@waynestate/pinstripe`) | Built (Pinstripe 0.1.4) |
| Security analysis | `phpstan/laravel.neon` (the env rule) and `phpstan/disallowed.neon` (the banned calls) are built; the Psalm taint pilot is not yet | Planned |

## Not adopted

- Mago and PHP_CodeSniffer 4 are not adopted; apps MUST use Pint as their
  only formatter (the stack's coding standard). No check exists yet.
- Mago is looked at again before Pinstripe 1.0 (the stack's coding standard).

## To be decided

- `declare(strict_types=1)` in every file. The sources recommend it, but
  the stack's coding standard does not decide it.
- `phpstan-strict-rules` for the stack's packages (the stack's coding standard).
- Where the ESLint package is published (the stack's coding standard).
